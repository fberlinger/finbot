# Finbot
Can Finbot reduce its energy consumption in a free swimming robot collective?

Finbot was used as a free swimming and autonomous fish-surrogate to study the energy efficiency of fish swimming.

Code is written in **C++** and optimized for running on an Arduino Pro Mini (5 V version, powered by an ATmega328).
